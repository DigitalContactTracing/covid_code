class DigitalContactTracing:
    """
    A class that implements digital contact tracing on a real contact network.

    The class loads an existing network and simulates the spread of a virus on
    the network, based on the characteristics of an infectious disease.
    At the same time, a digital contact tracing policy is implemented to try to
    contain the spread of the virus by enforcing isolation and quarantine,
    depending on a policy specification.
    The class keeps track of a number of relevant quantities (mainly, tracing
    efficacy and histories of quarantined individuals).

        Update the list of traced contacts.

        The method uses the current snapshot graph to update the list contacts,

        according to the policy, and adds them to the list of contacts.
        Moreover, the past contacts which are older than the tracing memory are
        discarded.
