## DigitalContactTracing

A class that implements digital contact tracing on a real contact network.

The class loads an existing network and simulates the spread of a virus on 
the network, based on the characteristics of an infectious disease. 
At the same time, a digital contact tracing policy is implemented to try to
contain the spread of the virus by enforcing isolation and quarantine, 
depending on the policy specifications.
The class keeps track of a number of relevant quantities (mainly, tracing 
efficacy and histories of quarantined individuals).
